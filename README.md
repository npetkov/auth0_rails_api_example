# README

This is a sample Rails 5 API project demonstrating API authentication with a JWT token issued by a third party identity 
provider. I'm using [auth0](https://auth0.com/), but the same principles apply for any OAuth provider, so feel free
to change your configuration accordingly. Please note that this project is meant as a proof of concept and shouldn't 
be used for any serious purposes without further consideration.

A separate [project](https://github.com/npetkov/auth0_rails_frontend_example) provides a very basic implementation of an 
API client (front end) that complements this one. I suggest checking it out and reading its documentation as well.
 
The motivation behind this project is to provide a brief, concise introduction to JWT authentication using Rails. 
I've read through a lot of resources covering different aspects of the topic so I decided to put them together in one 
working example. 

## Installation

Clone the repo and run the usual `bundle install`. I'm using ruby 2.3.2p217 and can't guarantee that everything will 
work as expected with earlier ( `< 2.2`) versions.
  
To launch the server, use `rails s -p 3001`. I prefer using port 3001 as I normally have another server listening to 
port 3000. Below, I'll assume the server is running at `htttp://localhost:3001`.
  
## Auth0 secret configuration
  
The project uses `config/auth0_dev.yml` in development to read the secret key used to sign JWT tokens. In a hypothetical
production environment, this should of course be provided via environmental variable or some other secure means. This key
can be found under 'Clients -> _(your auth0 client name)_ -> Settings' at the auth0 dashboard.
 
## API secret configuration

In a similiar fashion, `config/api_secret_key.yml` contains an ID for the API as well as a secret used to sign JWT tokens
issued by the API. A secret can be easily generated via `rake secret`.

## CORS

The server is configured to allow CORS requests from `http://localhost:3000` by default. This can be changed in
`config/initializers/cors.rb.

## Authentication flow

In order to obtain an API token, a client should supply a valid JWT issued by auth0. The complete flow is:
 
  1. Issue a `POST` request to `htttp://localhost:3001/auth/token`, with the auth0 token in a cookie named 
  `auth_token` or as `Authorization` header.
  2. The server verifies the following:
    
    1. The auth0 token provided, via the shared secret. Upon successful verification, the response is a simple 
       JSON object with a new API token which is valid for 10 minutes. Otherwise, the response will be 401 
       (no error messages etc. for now), including a `WWW-Authenticate` header denoting that expected auth0 token 
       wasn't valid.
    2. A `X-API-CSRF-TOKEN` header, preventing CSRF attacks from issuing API tokens. The header contains a digest
       that can only be calculated server-side. Since the frontend initiating the code grant flow and the API share
       the same secret, the header can be generated by the frontend and validated by the API.
        
  3. The client supplies the newly generated token with every request via `Authorization` header.

## Authorization
   
I've also included [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) in the project to demonstrate how per-endpoint authorization
can be achieved via JWT (please note that this doesn't include _per-resource_ authorization, which I hope to cover in the 
future). The prerequisite is that the JWT supplied to `auth/token` has a `scopes` field, listing the allowed actions
for every API endpoint. Consider this example:

```json
  {
    "iat": 1481815155,
    "exp": 1481815755,
    "aud": "2IYaN3ycGIs9JFcqDDtRCrx3P4odPJCi",
    "sub": "auth0|584ec9c7c641b4f41364bccf",
    "scopes": {
      "actions": {
        "notes": [
          "index",
          "create"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```

In the case of auth0, this can be achieved by adding the `scopes` object to the `app_metadata` of the user object,
resulting in a raw user object looking like this (most of the data left out for brevity):

```json
  {   
    "app_metadata": {
      "scopes": {
        "actions": {
          "notes": [
            "index",
            "create"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

Note that the `notes` field corresponds to the single data-endpoint defined in the API, which is `/notes`. So as
long as the token provided contains a whitelist of all actions allowed on that endpoint for the particular user, Pundit
will take care of the rest. The implementation is extremely basic and can be found in `app/policies/action_scope.rb`.

If you're using [Lock](https://github.com/auth0/lock) for sign in, the following options object will result in 
the `scopes` field being rendered at the root of the auth0 JWT: 

```javascript
  options = {
    auth: {
      params: {
        state: 'd69d13cf89c87481c67a977880f3b84ca626af25',
        scope: 'openid name email user_id scopes'
      },
    }
  }
```
